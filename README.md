firstJobApplication is a separate monolithic application and not part of our microservice architecture.
If you find the job application flow unclear,
you can refer to firstJobApplication as a reference to understand the overall process before working with the microservice-based application. 


This project, a unique creation of my own hands,
sprang forth from the guiding light of the EmbarkX tutorial series (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-gV3xtLqYg&list=PLxhSr_SLdXGPCS0F-4v5zEXATHnHLT7Qf),
a 21+ hour journey shaped by the esteemed Faisal Memon. 
This treasure of insight helped me navigate the winding paths of understanding, leading to a codebase born of my own efforts,
a reflection of my travels through its inspired ideas. Deep thanks go to Faisal Memon Sir for his grand gift of knowledge, a resource truly worth its weight in gold.
